**About**<br>
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly.

**Learning outcomes**<br>
With functions, loops, lists and other variables, this is a great project for Python basics. As a cherry on top, it even includes a random module.
